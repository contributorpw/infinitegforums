# Features
The TW Power Tools extension offers the following features/options:

## Infinite scroll
### Thread lists
> **Option name:** _Enable infinite scrolling in thread lists_.

Enables infinite scroll in thread lists in TW. This feature has already been
added to the Community Console by Google.

### Inside threads
> **Option names:** _Automatically load batches of messages inside threads when
scrolling down_, _Automatically load all messages at once inside threads when
scrolling down_.

Enables infinite scroll inside threads, both in TW and the Community Console.
Both options are mutually exclusive, and depending on which one you choose, the
feature will behave differently:

- **Load batches of messages**: when scrolling to the bottom, some more messages
will be loaded. If you scroll to the bottom again, more messages will be loaded,
and so on.
- **Load all messages at once**: when scrolling to the bottom, all the remaining
messages will be loaded at once.

## Additional enhancements
### Community Console toolbar
> **Option name:** _Fix the toolbar in thread lists in the Community Console_.

Fixes the toolbar of thread lists in the Community Console so it doesn't
disappear when scrolling down.

### Redirect to the Community Console
> **Option name:** _Redirect all threads opened in TW to the Community Console_.

This feature is useful if you want the threads you open from the email
notification link directly in the Community Console.

### Profile history
> **Option name:** _Show a "previous posts" link in user profiles_.

Both in TW and the Community Console, show 2 links in user profiles, which link
to the list of threads that the user has created/replied to in the current
forum, and in all the forums.

### Draft messages
> **Option name:** _Activate the `enableLoadingDraftMessages` Community Console
flag_.

Enables a Community Console flag which, when opening the reply dialog in a
thread in the Community Console, if a draft message was saved in the Google
servers, it is loaded in the editor.

Draft messages are saved regularly into Google Servers **even if the flag is not
enabled**, so this flag can help you recover your work from a crash, for
example.

### Contrast between read/unread threads
> **Option name:** _Increase contrast between read and unread threads in the
Community Console_.

In thread lists in the Community Console, the backgrounds for read and unread
threads are very similar. This option increases this contrast.

### Sticky drawer headers
> **Option name_** _Make the headers in the Community Console sidebar stick at
the top_.

### Dark mode
> **Option name:** _Enable the dark theme in the Community Console_.

This setting lets you load a custom-built dark theme for the Community Console.
In the options page there is a selector which lets you choose how the dark theme
gets enabled:

- **Switch in the Community Console**: a button appears at the top of the
Community Console, which lets you switch between the light and dark themes.
- **OS dark mode settings**: when you enable the OS wide dark mode setting (not
available in all Operating Systems), the dark theme is enabled in the Community
Console. Note that after you change the OS setting, you should reload the
Community Console in order to load the corresponding theme.

### Hide the Community Console drawer
> **Option name:** _Always hide the drawer (left column) in the Community
Console_.

When opening the Community Console, the sidebar which shows the forums, filters,
etc. will be hidden/closed by default. Useful if your screen is small.

### Drag and drop bookmarks to the text editor (Chrome-only)
> **Option name:** _Allow to drag and drop bookmarks to the Community Console
text editor_.

In Chrome, when drag and dropping bookmarks or Omnibox links to the Community
Console rich text editor, the bookmark/link title gets replaced by the URL.
This option reverses this so the text gets preserved.

### Batch lock
> **Option name:** _Add the option to lock multiple threads from the Community
Console thread list_.

### Indicator dot
> **Option names:** _Show whether the OP has participated in other threads_,
_Show the number of questions and replies written by the OP within the last `n`
months next to their username_.

This section includes options which are useful to determine whether an OP is a
newcomer or has posted in the forums before. A full description of what each
option does can be found at [docs/op\_indicator.md](op_indicator.md).

These are the possible combinations of both options:

- 1st option enabled, 2nd option disabled.
